# <code>(batter|pitcher)2vec</code>
`(batter|pitcher)2vec` is a model inspired by [`word2vec`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) that learns distributed representations of MLB players.
The associated paper, "[`(batter|pitcher)2vec`: Statistic-Free Talent Modeling With Neural Player Embeddings](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19ulLWQUgpIw-4pK5d7wa1lDhmhTiph37)", was one of eight (out of "nearly 200" submitted) selected to be presented in the [Research Papers Competition](https://web.archive.org/web/20180321223924/http://www.sloansportsconference.com/activities/research-papers/2018-research-paper-finalists-posters/) at the 2018 [MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/) (a recording of the presentation can be found [here](https://youtu.be/nQK44L9j9hY) and the slides can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vfpg7PANDlVyySCZsPqsOnJhUBFZMN9Q)).
I was lucky enough to advance to the final four, where each presenter gave a shorter presentation (recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0oAM4Q5hbM&feature=youtu.be&t=43m40s)) to a panel of judges consisting of Nate Silver (of FiveThirtyEight), Kirk Goldsberry (the guy who invented [these hexagonal shot charts](https://spatialjam.com/blog/hexbins)), and Will Edmonson (the Director of Analytics for Major League Baseball Advanced Media).
I ended up finishing in third place, which came with a $1,000 prize.
