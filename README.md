# <code>(batter|pitcher)2vec</code>
`(batter|pitcher)2vec` is a model inspired by [`word2vec`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) (hence the name) that learns distributed representations of MLB players. My paper on the project, [`(batter|pitcher)2vec`: Statistic-free talent modeling with neural player embeddings](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19ulLWQUgpIw-4pK5d7wa1lDhmhTiph37), was one of eight finalists (out of "nearly 200" submitted papers) selected to be presented in the [Research Papers Competition](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/activities/research-papers/2018-research-paper-finalists-posters/) at the 2018 [MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/) (a recording of the presentation can be found [here](https://youtu.be/nQK44L9j9hY)). Of the eight finalists, four were selected to move on to the finals to give a shorter presentation to a panel of judges consisting of Nate Silver (of FiveThirtyEight), Kirk Goldsberry (the guy who invented [these hexagonal shot charts](https://spatialjam.com/blog/hexbins)), and Will Edmonson (the Director of Analytics for Major League Baseball Advanced Media). I was lucky enough to end up making it to the finals (recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0oAM4Q5hbM&feature=youtu.be&t=43m40s)) and finished in third place, which came with a $1,000 prize. The Jupyter notebook [`batter_bitcher_2vec.ipynb`](https://github.com/airalcorn2/batter-pitcher-2vec/blob/master/batter_pitcher_2vec.ipynb) is entirely self-contained.
